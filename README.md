# JS for Designers

## Introduction

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

"Despite being used on pretty much every website on the internet, Javascript is actually one of the tougher languages to learn. In this short course, we specifically talk about Javascript targeted towards what a creative professional would use it for – functional and fun, interactive websites." - taken from SuperHi's short description of the course.

Each project is created as a separate React Component held in the `Pages/` directory and is a separate lesson covering important javascript fundamentals when coding and designing the front-end of a web application. Check their descriptions below for an deeper understanding.

## Projects

### Learning Objectives

During the course I learned:

- New context for how modern Javascript (ES6+) can work, from variables and strings to arrays and objects
- Working with smooth animation, transitions, and delays to make web designs look better
- Context. Making design changes, on the fly, as a user scrolls upa and down the page
- New context for how to work with browser interactions such as clicks, hovers, mouse movements and scroll events
- Add in subtle and not-so-subtle parallax effects to web designs
- Confidence in web design decisions.

## Getting Started: Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
